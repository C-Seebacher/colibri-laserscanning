This PCO.sdk is property of the PCO AG
you get these files from the PCO hompege 
http://www.pco.de
Dowload the SDK package e.g. 'SW_PCOSDKWIN_115.zip'
unzip, install, get the SC2_cam.dll from the bin and bin64 directories
I renamed the version in the bin directory to SC2_cam32.dll and that from the bin64 to SC2_cam64.dll to benefit from the * wildcard features of Labview. 
I do a call to SC2_cam*.* which is the appropriate file.
The sc2_cam.dll depend on an installed pco camera in the windows devive manager.
You should test the camera with the PCO Camware software available (in 32 and 64 bit) from the PCO homage.
The sdk-desciption is a document called MA_DCSDKWINE_115.pdf
