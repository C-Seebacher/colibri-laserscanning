Install Labview >=8.6
Install NI Vision Development Module (its Labview8 tools are enaugh)
Install Tortuoise, (reboot not really needed)

Create a folder for example c:\ScanMicroscope it should work on any drive in any subfolder with your favourite name. 
Labview sometimes uses sub-vis in different folders so delete or zip all old colibri files.
Right click this folder, "SVN checkout...", url=http://opensvn.csie.org/colibri/trunk/

Place the dlls for external devices you have (i am not sure if this is really important if they are already in system32):
C:\ScanMicroscope\Drivers\TILLPhotonics\tillimic.dll, 
C:\ScanMicroscope\Drivers\PCOSensicam\Senntcam.dll
C:\ScanMicroscope\Drivers\iXon\Atmcd32d.dll
Their 64bit versions are not tested and probably not supported for these devices. 

create a c:\temp folder and check if you are alowed to create files.

copy C:\ScanMicroscope\Configuration\Mic.ini and save it with a custom name like C:\ScanMicroscope\Configuration\MyXYSetup.ini
If you already have a Colibri.ini place it in the main path c:\ScanMicroscope otherwise it will be created when you run the software.

Edit the C:\ScanMicroscope\2Photon\Variables\MyXYSetup.ini, especially the following entries:
scan.adch.list="Dev1/ai0,Dev1/ai1" The AD-card and its channels
pmt.1.ch="Dev1/ao0"
pmt.2.ch="Dev1/ao1" the DA-Card for the Highvoltage
galvo.type="digital" if you have the digital TILL-Yanus with the 8MHz clock synchronisation
galvo.port="com4" - change to the comport of the Galvo controller.
And other comports... Poly, Laser, iMic

With the folowing lines you specify the drivers to load.
driver.list="driver.scan,driver.preview,driver.imic,driver.laser,driver.lasereom,driver.job,driver.pmt" delete entries you do not need (not really important)
in the following lines there are the details of the drivers to load:
driver.scan="DScanContinous.vi" Scanning and AD-Card aquisition, probably you need this
driver.preview="DFloatingPreview.vi" Pop-up images of the measurement, probably you want this, only if you have 1 detector you could use ViewImaq.vi accessable from the menu
driver.imic="Timicsdk.vi" for TILL-Microscopes
driver.laser="TMaitai.vi" for Spectra-Physics (Newport) MaiTai lasers
driver.lasereom="Deom.vi" for EOM control with a photodiode and a analog out port
driver.job="TJob.vi" for the internal scripting like z-stacks and time series
driver.pmt="THighVoltage.vi" to control the PMT-Gain with analog-out ports named "SpannungAO0" and "SpannungAO1"
driver.pco="DPCOContinous.vi" to get images from a old PCO-camera (Sensicam QE)
driver.poly="poly4.vi" for a TILL-Polychrome 2-4 connected to an Comport
the optional but recomendet list "....variables.list=" to what variable the driver is listening with a notifier, needed to stop a driver in a controled way.

Finally open and Run C:\ScanMicroscope\Colibri.vi 
If the ini is not existing or entries are missing you will be asked for 
check Error messages
A GUI will be loaded at the end
Check driver status with the tool Debug/Driver from the menu line. This tool can stop or start drivers.
YOu have to restart most drivers if you change important settings, but you usually don't have to restart the colibri. 

ToDO: Do a init-program for hardware testing. There is AD-externalclockTest.vi for the clock and the AD-converter speed.
