There is a strict number <> Image relation starting with 0
Normally the Imaqs are named scan0....scan12345789
Normally the tempfiles are named temp00000.tif ...
It is placed in c:\temp

Path from Scan to Saved Temp-file:
scan requests a new imaq: createIMAQ it has size 0,0 and Access=1
scan resizes the IMAQ, fills with data and sends IMAQ and metadata into SaveQueue
SaveImaqFromQueue.vi removes the elements, saves them to temp file (or altfilename?), saves Metadata, decreases Access, puts Numbers into SavedImaqQueue
DeleteImaqFromSavedQueue.vi checks space and deletes the oldest with access=0.

Problem was how to get memeory usage? 
See the tries in IMAQMemory.vi


test 217Bilder, 512x512, 115MB, abbe-computer
Timing: get IMAQStatus(DLL) 12ms per run. 31..
This MemoryUsage -1 needa 51-56ms per run! (32ms sub-vi)
Single MemeoryUsage needs 88ms (61ms sub-vi)
Metik.Datenmenge does not run! (delete Status..) 15-18ms/run and wrong number!

Is there something double? Memory of ImaqStorage is 225MB! Repaired (was T in MemoryUsage!)

BTW writeI16bitTiff_withtest need 1031ms for 186 images = 5.5ms = 94MB/s ???  data=4.5ms Head=0.8ms! saveIFD=0.1ms, down to 5ms average!
started pageing -> unuseable!!
contionous works with 30-40ms/image = 15MB/s!
