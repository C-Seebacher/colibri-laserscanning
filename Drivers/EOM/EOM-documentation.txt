This program (RegulateTomW.vi) changes the AnalogOut until it archices the desired Power measured with a Photodiode.
It can not change the Power very fast but within some ms. 
AnalogOut and Photodiode connections are defined in the EOM_IO.vi
Power calibration: Measure some datapoints: IRPower(wavelength) / EffectiveDiodeVoltage(wavelength) and put them into DiodeToPower.vi, DiodeVoltage is the effective Voltage corrected by DiodeEff.vi
Change Bias Voltage of the Conoptics Knob in EOMEstimate.vi (and if it does not work good, also the constants in EOMEstimate.vi)
If you can not readout the IR-Laserpower of the Laserhead, we have to estimate it: EstimateIR-Power: it contains some measured nm/mW values of the Laserhead
With EOMscan.vi you can measure a SetVoltage-EffPhotodiode Diagram.
