Installation of TILL-stage Technosoft-driverboard with colibri
todo: add images and screenshots

1. check the correct comport. For the USB-RS232 convertes unplug USB, check ports, plug again, check difference.
2. Get ID of Axis connected to Rs232 (Till-systems this is 1, blank boards this is 255)
3. Open "Technosoft_standalone.vi", enter Comport and ID, run it.
4. Check limit switches
4.1. run ?mer and bit 6 and 7 should be off
4.2. Plave a magnet close to the switches and check ?mer again.
4.3. Limit switch close to the motor must correspont to bit7 far from motor bit6, otherwise change cable.
5. check motion direction
5.1. program a motion away from motor: till_speed2=100, tillspeed=100, till_pos=123456 (larger than ?tpos)
5.2. goto tillabs and ensure the movement is away from the motor, otherwise change one polepair (at least towards the bit6 limit switch) 
6. calculate microstep-meter conversion: 256*StepsPerTurn/Pitch[m], if it is a position changer use "positions per turns" for Pitch
7. Edit the ini-parameters e.g
technosoft.port=com5
(see 1)
technosoft.hostaxis=1
(see 2)
technosoft.config=stage.x.set,1,51200000,0;stage.y.set,2,51200000,0
(name of motor, AxisNo, conversion see 6, Microstep offset used for Filter positions

Tested 20110607 for TILL-Firmware, 
I had to do correct 4.2 (one sensor not connected) and 5.2 (wrong direction)
