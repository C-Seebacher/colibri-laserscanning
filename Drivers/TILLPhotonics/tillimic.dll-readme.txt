You need the tillsdk for you operation system.
It is a file called tillimic.dll for 32-bit and 64-bit programs (i have 0.6.0.3).
Labvew has a feature to load the 32 or 64 bit version depending on the Labview version running.
It expects the name to be 
tillimic32.dll for 32bit, windows
tillimic64.dll for 64bit, windows
other OS would probably be tillimic64.so or tillimic46.framework. 
Place the renamed file in the TILLPhotonics folder.
Probably i am not allowed to add the dll's in the svn repository.
